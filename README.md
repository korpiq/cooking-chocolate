# Cooking Chocolate

I document here my attempts to learn to make chocolate by myself.

I want to learn to make chocolate, because I like it, but chocolate in shops is sweetened by sugar.
My dentist says sugar is bad for teeth and our health in general.
He says I should try to use erytritol or xylitol instead.
So I will try.

I will document my failures that may or may not lead to me learning how to do it,
because it can be interesting or even useful for others, too, to know what it takes to learn such a skill.
